# Express js Note Taker

## Description
    
This project is specifically targetting the back end of a note taking app. While working on this, I really gathered a targetted understanding of routes, and making proper CRUD requests in code. This application will create new notes featuring a title and text, post them to a JSON file, and, if the user chooses to delete them, will delete them from said file. I think that this was a great start to learning how routes function. Here is a link to the deployed application:

## Installation
    
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your desktop. Once in your code editor of choice, you will need to open your terminal and initialize npm with the command: npm init. Once you have npm initialized, you will install npm with the command: npm install. You will need to ensure that you have express, path, and uuid installed.
            
## Usage
    
To use the back end of this application, a user will need to initalize and install npm. You will then need to start the server with the command "npm start." Once you do so you will be able to make get, pull, and delete requests. From here the user will go to the browser to add notes, create a new note, and delete others that they see in the aside bar. Any new notes that they make will go to the db.json file and any deletions will be removed from this file.
